In this project, we successfully containerized an Angular application using Docker, leveraging the powerful features of Docker Compose to streamline the development and deployment processes. The setup begins with a Dockerfile that builds the application using the official Node.js image, which provides a clean and controlled environment for Node.js dependencies and the Angular CLI. This Dockerfile is designed to install necessary packages, copy application files, and set up the app to run with npm start, effectively using Angular CLI’s development server for live reloading during development. This approach ensures that any changes made to the application code are automatically reflected in the running container, enhancing developer productivity and experience.

To manage and run the Docker container, a docker-compose.yml file was created to define the service configuration, including volume mappings and port settings. This configuration facilitates the development by allowing the local codebase to be mounted directly into the container, thus preserving the state of the node modules and ensuring that the local development environment mirrors the containerized environment. By using Docker Compose, we can easily manage container orchestration, such as building, starting, and stopping the service, with simple commands. This encapsulation not only simplifies the initial setup for any developer new to the project but also ensures consistency across different development environments, reducing the “it works on my machine” syndrome and streamlining the path to production readiness.
